(1) This project is built using Web Development Framework Django. 

(2) This web app requires the following libraries (which are not built in packages):
	- Django
	- geopy
	- pymongo
	- requests
	- json
	- pandas

(3) I have created a batch file named "install_libraries.bat" which will install all the above libraries

(4) This app runs on localhost. To run this application:
	- Open command prompt and change directory inside the "ISE 589 Project" where "manage.py" file is saved
	- Execute the following code in command prompt

		python manage.py migrate

	- Then, run the following command to run the server,

		python manage.py runserver

	- Open localhost:8000

(5) I have created another batch file named "Batch_File" which will execute the steps shown above.
And on opening localhost:8000 the application will run.

(6) The Python files are in the "events" folder and the "html" file is in the "templates" folder

(7) Some of the python files were created by default when I created this project. The python files 
in which I have written code are:
	- background.py
	- dataframe.py
	- geocoder.py
	- mongodb.py
	- plots.py
	- traffic.py
	- views.py (This is the main file) 
	- weather.py
